# User oriented formatting

Currently, the data being show on screen is functional, but not pretty.

We'd like to format the currencies based on their locale: `510.55` -> `Â£510.55` for `GBP`.

And instead of `2022-06-24`, please change it to `June 2022`.

**Why are we asking you to do this?**

- It's really important that our apps don't _feel_ like "frontends to a database".
- We need to make sure that we format data in the way they'd expect to see it.
