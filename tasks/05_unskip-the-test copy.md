# Unskip the test

Inside [the tractions set suite](/src/components/transactions/index.test.tsx) there's a skipped test because the author couldn't get to pass, can you fix it for them please?

**Why are we asking you to do this?**

- Understanding how test work - especially in regards to when something _feels_ like it should work isn't is a really valuable debugging skill.
- Being able to pick up where someone left off is important.
